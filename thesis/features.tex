\section{Feature Extraction Methods}

In the classification of areas in satellite images, it is common for studies to use
a combination of features on which classification can be performed.
Our research will use methods for feature extraction that performed well in
previous research \cite{graesser2012image}. The methods that are used, are: the Histogram
of Oriented Gradients, Line Support Region features and Linear Feature
Distribution. Both the Histogram of Oriented Gradients and Line Support Regions
are already implemented in a framework created by Jordan Graesser. This
framework is a Python library, called spfeas, that is based on the
research Graesser et al conducted on the classification of formal and informal
settlements \cite{graesser2012image}. In addition to the features provided by
spfeas, this research will implement a new feature that measures the density of
road intersections in a given area, with the belief that area's with many
intersections are less likely to be informal.
