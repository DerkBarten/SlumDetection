\section{Features}

When classifying entire neighborhoods, it is common for studies to use
a combination of features for the classification between formal and informal.
Our research will use methods for feature extraction that performed well in
previous research \cite{graesser2012image}. The methods used are: the Histogram
of Oriented Gradients, Line Support Region features and Linear Feature
Distribution. Both the Histogram of Oriented Gradients and Line Support Regions
are already implemented in a framework created by Jordan Graesser. This
framework is a python library, called spfeas, that is based on the
research Graesser et al conducted on the classification of formal and informal
settlements \cite{graesser2012image}. In addition to the features provided by
spfeas, this research will implement a new feature that measures the density of
road intersections in a given area, with the belief that area's with many
intersections are less likely to be informal.


%This project reuses features that are proven to be able to well distinguish
%between formal and informal settlements by a paper from 2012
%\cite{graesser2012image}. The features that are used, are, as introduced
%earlier, HoG, LSR and LFD.
