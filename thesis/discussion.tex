% road intersection density:
% do not know if it didnt work because not all intersections detected or if the hypothesis is just wrong.
% The slums are too few and way too small with these approaches

% Why test image 2 works best?



Besides that, it is hard to evaluate if the hypothesis for slum detection is correct. This is because we do not know if the hypothesis is false or if the intersection extraction does not produce correct intersections. This is why it is important to have a ground truth of the intersections in the image because this allows to conclude with reasonable certainty if this approach method for slum detection is valid.
