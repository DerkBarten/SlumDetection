\section{Future Work}
As you now know, we performed the experiments on three test images. These images are only a small part of the whole image. This was done to reduce computational load and decrease the class imbalance. We have not classified using the whole image, although this could be the next logical step.

would be classification of the whole image as a test set, and the three sections as training set.
