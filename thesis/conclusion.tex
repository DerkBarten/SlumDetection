\section{Conclusion}

Our approach was able to detect slums on the provided images, albeit with limited performance. We have experimented with different sets of parameters to find the best combination, which produced Matthews Coefficient of 0.17. We found that the Histogram of Gradients and GradientBoosting generally achieves the highest performed. Our proposed method for the detection of slums using road detection did not seem to produce useful results, although the intersection detection might be applicable for different problems. The effect of different scales is still debatable and increased block size does not seem to impact the performance of the features. All oversampling methods we have experimented with resulted in similar performance, which is significantly higher than no oversampling at all. Our methods combined with additional  features may improve performance further.

%\section{Future Work}
%As you now know, we performed the experiments on three test images. These images are only a small part of the whole image. This was done to reduce computational load and decrease the class imbalance. We have not classified using the whole image, although this could be the next logical step.
%
%would be classification of the whole image as a test set, and the three sections as training set.
