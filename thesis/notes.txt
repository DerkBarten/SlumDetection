*	hoe uitgebreid uitleg LSR, HoG
*	omranding van sloppenwijken shapefiles

*	Explain data
*	explain composition of slums

*	calculate surface area of slum in both files

*	detailed implementation of new feature 

*	show 3 sections in challenges section

show positions of sections on whole map
new images of sections

not sure about 4 Hog features when 5 in shape

why increased scale works?

*	under challenges: in our case, highly distributed slums

do correct error handling

*	CREATE MORE ELABORTE LITERATURE STUDY IN PREVIOUS WORK

*	test hog and slr for block size of 10

create parameter selection section for every feature and classification thing


objective measure for difference in distribution, feature evaluation

*	meer info bangalore

problem, the 3 sections all need different road parameters

*	check actually west bangalore and not east

*	waarom slum detection zo moeilijk is

more results of previous work!!! how did those researches go??

road segment detection

*	create new sections, 2 and 3 don't work well

*	perhaps my features only work on large scale?

distribution KDE plots are not correctly labeled, should be the other way around

Originally goal unsupervised, but supervised isnt even working

say something about threshold slum parameter?

more precise experiment setup

add numbers to whole bangalore map

should use mean with lower and upper bound indicators?

show getis ords hotspots

finish feature evaluation for RID

fix confusion plots

hog performs better than lsr for section 2!!!????



############### roads ###############

try different widths
try different shapes

longer length of roads to capture intersections better
convolution changes location of peaks by a contant number

method for determining the best parameters or best method?
metrics??


needs to be large contrast between roads and surroundings

create section about the kernels

problem: not enough contrast between roads and surroundings -> solution: otsu

expand on gaussian kernel: std-dev enzo

add disclaimer that no ground truth

---------------------------------

G_local is scale invariant
use G, G_local, and morian as 3 features?
create block size and scale in creature of matrix
