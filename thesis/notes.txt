########################### HoG ######################################3
how HoG changes between scales?
HoG too coarse?
deltas are useless?
only second mean interesting?
variance of histogam, high -> slums, low ->formal
how to get shapefiles to work in grass?
beta only gives noise?
hog difficult differntiate small buildings from large buildings
hog only usefull large scale?
check if beta is OK



hog only used for differentiate between buildings and fields
weird lines in HoG

######################### General ########################################

LFD not implemented spfeas

hoe uitgebreid uitleg LSR, HoG, LFD

omranding van sloppenwijken shapefiles


Explain data
explain composition of slums


calculate surface area of slum in both files

detailed implementation of new feature 

show 3 sections in challenges section

termonology of subfeatures of feature

show positions of sections on whole map
new images of sections


feature evaluation: more detailed analysis of the distributions??
like properties of the distribution (mean, variance etc)

conclusion in feature evaluation


redo all features
fix 3 scales stuff 


not sure about 4 Hog features when 5 in shape

why increased scale works?

PUSH IT TO THE LIMIT, try very high scales, see where it plateau's.
can still let the other results be, just say they are for illustration.

under challenges: in our case, highly distributed slums

do correct error handling
fix other ugly scripts

move challenges sections somewhere else

############### roads ###############

try different widths
try different shapes

longer length of roads to capture intersections better
convolution changes location of peaks by a contant number

width of road in pixels in kernel should roughly match width of road in image

method for determining the best parameters or best method?
metrics??

say which file intersection extraction tested on
make road intersection density separate section

inspired by footprints in different paper

add section explaining what the thesis does (proposed method)
and put this with previous work under introduction
