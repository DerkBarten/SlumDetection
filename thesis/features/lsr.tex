\subsection{Line Support Region Features}

The formality of neighborhoods can be determined by observing the spatial
distribution of neighborhoods. In the same manner as HoG characterized
neighboorhoods by the orientation its buildings, neighborhoods, alternatively,
can be characterized by the size of their buildings. Informal settlements
generally lack the precence of large buildings in contrast with formal
settlements. The size of constructions can be characterised using the Line
Support Region (LSR) features \cite{unsalan2004classifying}. Likewise to HoG, LSR utilizes gradients
calulated from remote sensing imagery. LSR uses the fact that perfectly
straight lines have uniform gradients. In practice however, photographs never
contain perfectly straight lines, which results in similar but non uniform
gradients of lines. Therefore, LSR uses groups similar gradients to represent
a line in images to detect semi straight lines in images \cite{burns1986extracting}.
